# Relation to the United States

Puerto Rico is currently a commonwealth of the United States.  
A **Commonwealth** is defined as *“an organized United States insular 
area, which has established with the Federal Government, a more highly developed relationship, usually embodied in a written mutual agreement.”*

Yes, its relationship with the US is very confusing. I like to describe it to people as "a state that is not considered part of the 50". Its the easiest way for 
people to understand. 

Puertoricans are born US citizens, but they cannot vote for President of the US. They participate in the primary elections though. PR has its own "Constitution".
I put it in quotes because even though it is considered an official document, the American constitution overrides it when applied. 


Fun fact:
- You do not need a passport to travel to Puerto Rico from the mainland. Just an ID like you would for any other state.
