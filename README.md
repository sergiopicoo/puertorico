# Puerto Rico

## Do you want a tropical place to vacation in within American jurisdiction?   
[Puerto Rico](https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/) is your place to go. 

Capital: San Juan  
Population: 3,143,000

- I want to show you my home state. This is where I grew up, where I was raised, and where most of my family is.   
Moving here was difficult for me, leaving my life behind. Adjusting though, was not super hard due to Puerto Rico's rich and diverse culture.   
- Puerto Rico's [association with the United States](americanrelation.md) made it a lot easier to adjust. I was fortunate enough to already be fully bilingual (as most people in PR)
when I moved here.   
- The [food](https://www.ezcater.com/lunchrush/office/primer-puerto-rican-dishes-cuisine-try-ever-right-now/) though, was very hard to recreate with the ingredients available in Columbia. This caused a lot of home sickness for me. I felt like 
food was a way for me to connect with my culture easily, and that was not very possible.  
- Another aspect that made me miss PR so much was Columbia's climate compared to [Puerto Rico's](climate.md). Columbia being in the Midwest, is either extremely hot or extremely cold. PR in the other hand, nice and warm during the day and most nights turn into "hoodie weather".
